# Robot Data Collection Configuration Files

This directory contains the configuration files for the five data collection WidowX robots used in the paper. Minus some per-robot idiosyncratic changes, the configs are identical across robots.

When setting up a robot for autonomous data collection, all changes you should need to make should be localized to the config subdirectory (i.e., you should not need to make any code changes). We have provided a detailed README under `berkeley_robot_0` with explanations of what the various configurations control and what needs to be modified for your setup.
